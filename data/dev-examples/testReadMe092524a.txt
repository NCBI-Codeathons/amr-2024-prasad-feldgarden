SAMN11110706.nuc.fa has a MexR frameshift after pos. 107 (aa); in nucleotide space, in the query, pos. 116-126 are missing, and in the query this corresponds to pos. 245917-245925 in DAHMTF010000002.1
SAMN11110537.nuc.fa has an ampD stop at pos. 108 E_to stop; pos. 37418 in DAHNQV010000008.1
SAMN03105473.nuc.fa has a nalD frameshift at pos. 131; in nucleotide space, there is a deletion at 394-397 in the ref. and pos. 59736-59739 in JTXK01000022.1
The two ompK35 sequences are taken from the test data for Kleborate (https://github.com/klebgenomics/Kleborate/tree/main/test/test_res_omp); these are found in actualKP_testgenomes:
1. An early stop at pos. 36 (Y to *) ; in nucleotide space, pos. 1035 has C to T in the reference, 3220 in the test sequence
2. A frameshift at pos. 116; in nucleotide space, pos. 345 in the reference has an insertion (A), pos. 3084 in the test sequence
